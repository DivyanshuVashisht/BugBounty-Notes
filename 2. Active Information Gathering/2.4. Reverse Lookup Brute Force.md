# Reverse Lookup Brute Force
Our DNS forward brute force enumeration revealed a set of scattered IP addresses in the same approximate range (38.100.139.X). If the DNS administrator of megacorpone.com configured PTR records for the domain, we could scan the approximate range with reverse lookups to request the hostname for each IP.

We have successfully managed to resolve a number of IP addresses to valid hosts using reverse DNS lookups. If we were performing an assessment, we could further extrapolate these results, and might scan for "mail1", "mail2", etc and reverse lookup positive results. The point is that these types of scans are often cyclical; we expand our search based on any information we receive at every round.
