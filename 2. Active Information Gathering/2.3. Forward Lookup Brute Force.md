# Forward Lookup Brute Force
Brute force is a trial-and-error technique that seeks to find valid information, including directories on a webserver, username and password combinations, or in this case, valid DNS records. By using a wordlist that contains common hostnames, we can attempt to guess DNS records and check the response for valid hostnames.

We can automate the forward DNS lookup of common hostnames using the **host** command in a Bash one-liner.

First, let's build a wordlist of possible hostnames:
````
kali@kali:~$ cat list.txt
www
ftp
mail
owa
proxy
router
````

Next, we can use a Bash one-liner to attempt to resolve each hostname:

````
kali@kali:~$ for ip in $(cat list.txt); do host $ip.megacorpone.com; done
www.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.76
Host ftp.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
mail.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.84
Host owa.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
Host proxy.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
router.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.71
````

With this simplified wordlist, we discovered entries for "www", "mail", and "router". The hostnames "ftp", "owa", and "proxy", however, were not found. Much more comprehensive wordlists are available as part of the SecLists project. These wordlists can be installed to the **/usr/share/seclists** directory using the **sudo apt install seclists** command.
