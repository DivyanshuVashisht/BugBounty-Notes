# Automating lookups
Now that we have some initial data from the megacorpone.com domain, we can continue to use additional DNS queries to discover more hostnames and IP addresses belonging to the same domain. 

````
kali@kali:~$ host www.megacorpone.com
www.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.76
````

Now, let's see if megacorpone has a server with the hostname "idontexist". Notice the difference between the query outputs:

````
kali@kali:~$ host idontexist.megacorpone.com
Host idontexist.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
````

In first output, we queried a valid hostname and received an IP resolution response. By contrast the second output returned an error (NXDOMAIN) that indicated that a public DNS record does not exist for that hostname. Now that we understand how to search for valid hostnames, we can automate our efforts
