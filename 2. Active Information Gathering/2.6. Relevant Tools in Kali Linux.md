# 2.6.1 DNSRecon
DNSRecon is an advanced, modeern DNS enumeration script written in Python. Running **dnsrecon** against megacorpone.com using the **-d** option to specify a domain name, and **-t** to specify the type of enumeration to perform (in this case a zone transfer), produces the following output:
```
kali@kali:~$ dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -t axfr

```

Based on the output above, we have managed to perform a successful DNS zone transfer against the megacorpone.com domain. The result is basically a full dump of the zone file for the domain.

Let's try to brute force additional hostnames using the **list.txt** file we created previously for forward lookups. That list looks like this:
```
kali@kali:~$ cat list.txt
www
ftp
mail
owa
proxy
router
```

To begin the brute force attempt, we'll use the **-d** option to specify the domain name, **-D** to specify a file name containing potential subdomain strings, and **-t** to specify the type of enumeration to perform (in this case **brt** for brute force):
```
kali@kali:~$ dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -D ~/list.txt -t brt
[*] Performing host and subdomain brute force against megacorpone.com
[*] A router.megacorpone.com 38.100.193.71
[*] A www.megacorpone.com 38.100.193.76
[*] A mail.megacorpone.com 38.100.193.84
[+] 3 Records Found
```

Our brute force attempt has finished, and we have managed to resolve a few hostnames.

# 2.6.2 DNSenum
DNSEnum is another popular DNS enumeration tool . To show a different output, let's run **dnsenum** against the zontransfer.me domain (which is owned by DigiNinja and specifically allows zone transfers):
```
kali@kali:~$ dnsenum zonetransfer.me
dnsenum.pl VERSION:1.2.2

These enumeration tools are both capable and straightforward.
