# DNS Zone Transfer
A zone transfer is basically a database replication between related DNS servers in which the zone file is copied from a master DNS server to a slave server. The zone file contains a list of all the DNS names configured for that zone. Zone transfers should only be allowed to authorized slave DNS servers but many administrators misconfigure their DNS servers, and in these cases, anyone asking for a copy of the DNS server zone will usually receive one.

A successful zone transfer does not directly result in a network breach, although it does facilitate the process.

The **host** command syntax for performing a zone transfer is as follows:
```
host -l <domain name> <dns server address>
```

From our earliest host command, we noticed that three DNS servers serve the megacorpone.com domain: ns1, ns2 and ns3. 

We will use **host -l** (list zone) to attempt the zone transfers
```
kali@kali:~$ host -l megacorpone.com ns1.megacorpone.com
Using domain server:
Name: ns1.megacorpone.com
Address: 38.100.193.70#53
Aliases:
Host megacorpone.com not found: 5(REFUSED)
; Transfer failed.
```

Unfortunately, it looks like the first nameserver, ns1, does not allow DNS zone transfers, so our attempt has failed.

Let's try to perform the same steps using the second nameserver, ns2:
```
kali@kali:~$ host -l megacorpone.com ns2.megacorpone.com
Using domain server:
Name: ns2.megacorpone.com
Address: 38.100.193.80#53
Aliases:
megacorpone.com name server ns1.megacorpone.com.
megacorpone.com name server ns2.megacorpone.com.
megacorpone.com name server ns3.megacorpone.com.
admin.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.83
beta.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.88
fs1.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.82
intranet.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.87
mail.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.84
mail2.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.73
ns1.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.70
...
```

This server allows zone transfers and provides a full dump of the zone file for the megacorpone.com domain, delivering a convenient list of IP addresses and corresponding DNS hostnames!

To attempt a zone transfer with the **host** command, we need two parameters: a nameserver address and a domain name. We can get the nameservers for a given domain with the following command:
```
kali@kali:~$ host -t ns megacorpone.com | cut -d " " -f 4
ns1.megacorpone.com.
ns2.megacorpone.com.
ns3.megacorpone.com.
```

Taking a step further, we can write a Bash script to automate the process of identifying the relevant nameservers and attempting a zone transfer from each:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Simple Zone Transfer Bash Script
# $1 is the first argument given after the bash script
# Check if argument was given, if not, print usage
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
echo "[*] Simple Zone transfer script"
echo "[*] Usage : $0 <domain name> "
exit 0
fi
# if argument was given, identify the DNS servers for the domain
for server in $(host -t ns $1 | cut -d " " -f4); do
# For each of these servers, attempt a zone transfer
host -l $1 $server |grep "has address"
done
```


Now we'll make the script executable and run it against megacorpone.com:
```
kali@kali:~$ chmod +x dns-axfr.sh
kali@kali:~$ ./dns-axfr.sh megacorpone.com
admin.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.83
beta.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.88
fs1.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.82
intranet.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.87
mail.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.84
mail2.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.73
ns1.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.70
ns2.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.80
ns3.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.90
router.megacorpone.com has address 38.100.193.71
...
```
