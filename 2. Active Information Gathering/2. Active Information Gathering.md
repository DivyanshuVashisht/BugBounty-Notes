# Active Information Gathering
We'll move beyond passive information gathering and explore techniques that involve direct interaction with target services. We'll take a look at some foundational techniques but bear in miind there are innumerable services that can be targeted in the field. This includes Active Directory for example. However, we'll look at some of the more common active information gathering techniques in this module including port scanning and DNS, SMB, NFS, SMTP, and SNMP enumeration.
