# Port Scanning
Port scanning is the process of inspecting TCP or UDP ports on a remote machine with the intention of detecting what services are running on the target and what potential attack vectors may exist.

## TCP / UDP Scanning
We'll begin our exploration of port scanning with a simple TCP and UDP port scan using Netcat. It should be noted that Netcat is **not** a port scanner, but it can be used as such in a rudimentary way. Since it's already present on many systems, we can repurpose some of its functionality to mimic a basic port scan when we are not in need of fully-featured port scanner. However, there are far better tools dedicated to port scanning that we'll explore in detail.

### TCP Scanning
The simplest TCP port scanning technique, usually called CONNECT scanning, relies on the three-way handshake mechanism. This mechanism is designed so that two hosts attempting to communicate can negotiate the parameters of the network TCP socket connection before transmitting any data. 

We'll run a TCP Netcat port scan on ports 3388-3390. The **-w** option specifies the connection timeout in seconds and -z is used to specify zero-I/O mode, which will send no data and is used for scanning:
```
kali@kali:~$ nc -nvv -w 1 -z 10.11.1.220 3388-3390
(UNKNOWN) [10.11.1.220] 3390 (?) : Connection refused
(UNKNOWN) [10.11.1.220] 3389 (?) open
(UNKNOWN) [10.11.1.220] 3388 (?) : Connection refused
sent 0, rcvd 0
```

Based on this output, we can see that port 3389 is open while connections on port 3388 and 3390 timed out. 


### UDP Scanninig
Since UDP is stateless and does not involve a three-way handshake, the mechanism behind UDP port scanning is different from TCP.

Let's run a UDP Netcat port scan against ports 160-162 on a different target. This is done using the only **nc** option we have not seen yet, **-u**, which indicates a UDP scan:
```
kali@kali:~$ nc -nv -u -z -w 1 10.11.1.115 160-162
(UNKNOWN) [10.11.1.115] 161 (snmp) open
```

### Common Port Scanning Pitfalls
UDP scanning can be problematic for several reasons. First, UDP scanning is often unreliable, as firewalls and routers may drop ICMP packets. This can lead to false positives and ports showing as open when they are, in fact, closed. Second, many port scanners do not scan all available ports, and usually have a pre-set list of "interesting ports" that are scanned. This means open UDP ports can go unnoticed. Using a portocol-specific UDP port scanner may help in obtaining more accurate results. Finally, penetration testers often foget to scan for open UDP ports, instead focusing on the "more exciting" TCP ports. Although UDP scanning can be unreliable, there are plenty of attack vectors lurking behind open UDP ports.

## Port Scanning with Nmap
Nmap is one of the most popular, versatile, and robust port scanners available. It has been actively developed for over a decade and has numeraous features beyond port scanning.

### Accountability for Our Traffic
A default Nmap TCP scan will scan the 1000 most popular ports on a given machine. Before we start running scans blindly, let's examine the amount of traffic sent by this type of scan. We'll scan one of the lab machines while monitoring the amount of traffic sent to the target host using **iptables**.

We'll use several **iptables** options. First, we'll use the **-I** option to insert a new rule into a given chain, which in this case includes both the **INPUT** (inbound) and **OUTPUT**(Outbound) chains followed by the rule number. We'll use **-s** to specify the source IP adderss, **-d** to specify a destination IP address, and **-j** to **ACCEPT** the traffic. Lastly, we'll use the **-Z** option to zero the packet and byte counters in all chains.
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -s 10.11.1.220 -j ACCEPT
kali@kali:~$ sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 10.11.1.220 -j ACCEPT
kali@kali:~$ sudo iptables -Z
```

Now let's generate some traffic using **nmap**.
```kali@kali:~$ nmap 10.11.1.220
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:20 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.220
Host is up (0.29s latency).
Not shown: 980 closed ports
PORT STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open ftp
53/tcp open domain
88/tcp open kerberos-sec
135/tcp open msrpc
139/tcp open netbios-ssn
389/tcp open ldap
445/tcp open microsoft-ds
464/tcp open kpasswd5
593/tcp open http-rpc-epmap
636/tcp open ldapssl
3268/tcp open globalcatLDAP
3269/tcp open globalcatLDAPssl
3389/tcp open ms-wbt-server
...
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 46.29 seconds
```

Tha scan completed and revealed a few open ports.

Now let's look at some **iptables** statistics to get an idea of how much traffic our scan generated. We'll use the **-v** option to add some verbosity to our output, **-n** to enable numeric output, and **-L** to list the rules present in all chains:
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo iptables -vn -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 1528 packets, 226K bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
1263 51264 ACCEPT all -- * * 10.11.1.220 0.0.0.0/0
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 1323 packets, 191K bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
1314 78300 ACCEPT all -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 10.11.1.220
```

According to this output, this default 1000-port scan has generated around 78KB of traffic.

Let's use **iptables -Z** to zero the packet and byte counters in all chains again and run another **nmap** scan using **-p** to specify ALL TCP ports:
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo iptables -Z
kali@kali:~$ nmap -p 1-65535 10.11.1.220
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:27 EST

pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
66768 4006K ACCEPT all -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 10.11.1.220
```

A similar local port scan explicitly probing all 65535 ports generated about 4MB of traffic, a significantly higher amount. However, this full port scan has discovered new ports that were not found by the default TCP scan.

### Stealth / SYN Scanning
Nmap's prefered scannig technique is a SYN, or "stealth" scan. There are many benefits to using a SYN scan and as such, it is the default scan technique used when no scan technique is specified in an **nmap** command and the user has the required raw socket privileges.

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS 10.11.1.220
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:27 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.220
Host is up (1.3s latency).
Not shown: 980 closed ports
PORT STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open ftp
53/tcp open domain
88/tcp open kerberos-sec
135/tcp open msrpc
139/tcp open netbios-ssn
389/tcp open ldap
445/tcp open microsoft-ds
464/tcp open kpasswd5
...
```

### TCP Connect Scanning
When a user running **nmap** does not have raw socket privileges, Nmap will default to the TCP connect scan technique described earlier. Since a Nmap TCP connect scan makes use of the Berkeley sockets API to perform the three-way handshake, it does not require elevated privileges. However, because Nmap has to wait for the connection to complete before the API will return the status of the connection, a connect scan takes much longer to complete than SYN scan.

There might be times when we need to specifically perform a connect scan with **nmap**, for example, when scanning via certain types of proxies. We use the **-sT** option to start a connect scan:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -sT 10.11.1.220
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:37 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.220
Host is up (1.3s latency).
Not shown: 980 closed ports

135/tcp open msrpc
139/tcp open netbios-ssn
389/tcp open ldap
445/tcp open microsoft-ds
464/tcp open kpasswd5
...
```


### UDP Scanning
When performing a UDP scan, Nmap will use a combination of two different methods to determine if a port is open or closed. For most ports, it will use the standard "ICMP port unreachable" method described earlier by sending an empty packet to a given port. However, for common ports, such as port 161, which is used by SNMP, it'll send a protocol-specific SNMP packet in an attempt to get a response from an application bound to that port. To perform a UDP scan, the **-sU** option is used and **sudo** is required to access raw sockets:
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sU 10.11.1.115
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:46 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.115

111/udp open rpcbind
137/udp open netbios-ns
161/udp open snmp
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 22.49 seconds
```

The UDP scan (**-sU**) can also be used in conjunction with a TCP SYN scan (**-sS**) option to build a more complete picture of our target:
```
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 12:46 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.115

111/udp open rpcbind
137/udp open netbios-ns
161/udp open snmp
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 64.74 seconds
```

### Network Sweeping
To deal with large volumes of hosts, or to otherwise try to conserve network traffic, we can attempt to probe targets using _Network Sweeping Techniques_, in which we begin with broad scans, and use more specific scans against hosts of interest.

When performing a network sweep with Nmap using the **-sn** option, the host discovery process consists of more than just sending an ICMP echo request. Several other probes are used in addition to the ICMP request. Nmap also sends a TCP SYN packet to port 443, a TCP ACK packet to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request to verify if a host is available or not.
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -sn 10.11.1.1-254
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:27 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.5
Host is up (0.026s latency).
MAC Address: 00:50:56:89:70:15 (VMware)

MAC Address: 00:50:56:89:36:32 (VMware)
...
Nmap done: 254 IP addresses (44 hosts up) scanned in 6.14 seconds
```

Searching for live machines using the **grep** command on a standard nmap output can be cumbersome. Instead, we'll use Nmap's "greppable" output parameter, **-oG**, to save these results into a format that is easier to manage:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -v -sn 10.11.1.1-254 -oG ping-sweep.txt

10.11.1.5
10.11.1.7
10.11.1.8
...
```

We can also sweep for specific TCP or UDP ports across the network, probing the common services and ports, in an attempt to locate systems that may be usedful, or otherwise have known vulnerabilities. This scan tends to be more accurate than ping sweep:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -p 80 10.11.1.1-254 -oG web-sweep.txt
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:38 EST

10.11.1.8
10.11.1.10
10.11.1.13
...
```

To save time and network resources, we can also scan multiple IPs, probing for a short list of common ports. For example, let's conduct a TCP connect scan for the top twenty TCP ports with the **--top-ports** option and enable OS version detection, script scanning, and traceroute with **-A**:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 10.11.1.1-254 -oG top-port-sweep.txt
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:40 EST

...
Host script results:
|_nbstat: NetBIOS name: ALICE, NetBIOS user: <unknown>, NetBIOS MAC: 00:50:56:89:70:15

...
```

The top twenty **nmap** ports are determined using the **/usr/share/nmap-services** file. The file uses a simple format of three whitespace-separated columns. The first is the name of the service, the second contains the port number, and the third, the "port frequence". The port frequency is based on how often the port was found open during research scans of the internet:
```
kali@kali:~$ cat /usr/share/nmap/nmap-services
...
finger 79/udp 0.000956
http 80/sctp 0.000000 # www-http | www | World Wide Web HTTP
http 80/tcp 0.484143 # World Wide Web HTTP

hosts2-ns 81/tcp 0.012056 # HOSTS2 Name Server
hosts2-ns 81/udp 0.001005 # HOSTS2 Name Server
...
```

### OS Fingerprinting
Nmap has a built-in feature called _OS fingerprinting_, which can be enabled with the **-O** option. This feature attempts to guess the target's operating system by inspecting returned packets. This is possible because operating systems often have slightly different implementations of the TCP/IP stack (such as varying default TTL values and TCP window sizes) and these slight variances create a fingerpring that Nmap can often identify.

Nmap will inspect the traffic recived from the target machine and attempt to match the fingerprint to a known list.
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -O 10.11.1.220
...
Device type: general purpose
Running: Microsoft Windows 2008|7
OS CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2 cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_7
OS details: Microsoft Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2
Network Distance: 1 hop
...
```

The response suggests that the underlying operating system of this target is either windows 7 or windows 2008 R2.


### Banner Grabbing / Service Enumeration
We can also identify services running on specific ports by inspecting service banners (**-sV**) and running various OS and service enumeration scripts (**-A**) against the target:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -sV -sT -A 10.11.1.220
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:27 EST

07:37:57Z)
135/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC
...
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 55.67 seconds
```

Keep in mind that baanners can be modified by system administrators. As such, these can be intentionally set to fake service names in order to mislead a potential attacker.


### Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
We can use the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to launch user-created scripts in order to automate various scanning tasks. These scripts perform a broad range of functions including DNS enumeration, brute force attacks, and even vulnerability identification. NSE Scripts are located in the **/usr/share/nmap/scripts** directory.

For example, the smb-os-discovery script attempts to connect to the SMB service on a target system and determine its operating system:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap 10.11.1.220 --script=smb-os-discovery
...
OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard 7601 Service Pack 1 (Windows Server 2008 R2 Sta
| OS CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_server_2008::sp1
| Computer name: master
| NetBIOS computer name: MASTER\x00
| Domain name: thinc.local
| Forest name: thinc.local
| FQDN: master.thinc.local
|_ System time: 2013-12-27T23:37:58-08:00
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.85 seconds
```

Another useful (and self-explanatory) NSE script is **dns-zone-transfer**:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap --script=dns-zone-transfer -p 53 ns2.megacorpone.com
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:54 EST
Nmap scan report for ns2.megacorpone.com (38.100.193.80)
Host is up (0.010s latency).
Other addresses for ns2.megacorpone.com (not scanned):
PORT STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open domain
| dns-zone-transfer:

| megacorpone.com. MX 60 mail2.megacorpone.com.
| megacorpone.com. NS ns1.megacorpone.com.
...
```

To view more informatino about a script, we can use the **--script-help** option, which displays a description of the script and a URL where we can find more in-depth information, such as the script arguments and usage examples.
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap --script-help dns-zone-transfer
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-05-06 11:02 MDT

determined by examining the name given on the command line, the DNS
server's hostname, or it can be specified with the
<code>dns-zone-transfer.domain</code> script argument. If the query is
successful all domains and domain types are returned along with common
type specific data (SOA/MX/NS/PTR/A).
...
```

## Masscan
Masscan is arguably the fastest port scanner; it can scan the entire internet in about 6 minutes, transmitting an astounding 10 million packets per second! While it was originally designed to scan the entire Internet, it can easily handle a class A or B subnet, which is more suitable target range during a penetration test.

We can locate all machines on a large internal network with TCP port 80 open (using the **-p80** option). Since masscan implements a custom TCP/IP stack it will require access to raw sockets and therefore requires **sudo**.
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo masscan -p80 10.0.0.0/8
```

To try masscan on a class C subnet in the PWK internal lab network, we can use the following example. We will add a few additional **masscan** options, including **--rate** to specify the desired rate of packet transmission, **-e** to specify the raw network interface to use, and **--router-ip** to specify the IP adderss for the appropriate gateway:
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo masscan -p80 10.11.1.0/24 --rate=1000 -e tap0 --router-ip 10.11.0.1

```

# SMB Enumeration
The security track record of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol has been poor for many years due to its complex implementation and open nature. From unauthenticated SMB null sessions in windows 2000 and XP, to a plethora of SMB bugs and vulnerabilities over the years, SMB has seen its fair share of action. 

### Scanning for NetBIOS Service
The NetBIOS service listens on TCP port 139 as well as several UDP ports. It should be noted that SMB (TCP port 445) and NetBIOS are two separate protocols. NetBIOS is an independent session layer protocol and service that allows computers on a local network to communicate with each other. While modern implementations of SMB can work without NetBIOS, NetBIOS over TCP (NBT) is required for backward compatibility and is often enabled together. 
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 10.11.1.1-254
```

There are other more specialized tools for specifically identifying NetBios information, such as **nbtscan**, which is used in the following example. The **-r** option is used to specify the originating UDP port as 137, which is used query the NetBIOS name service for valid NetBIOS names:
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nbtscan -r 10.11.1.0/24

### Nmap SMB NSE Scripts
Nmap contains many useful NSE scripts that can be used to discover and enumerate SMB services. These scripts can be found in **/usr/share/nmap/scripts/** directory:
```
kali@kali:~$ ls -1 /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb*
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb2-capabilities.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb2-security-mode.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb2-time.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb2-vuln-uptime.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-brute.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-double-pulsar-backdoor.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-enum-domains.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-enum-groups.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-enum-processes.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-enum-sessions.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-enum-shares.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-enum-users.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-os-discovery.nse
...
```

Here we'll find several interesting Nmap SMB NSE scripts that perform various tasks such as OS dicscovery and enumeration via SMB.
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -v -p 139, 445 --script=smb-os-discovery 10.11.1.227
...
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.227
Host is up (0.57s latency).
PORT STATE SERVICE
139/tcp open netbios-ssn
Host script results:
| smb-os-discovery:
| OS: Windows 2000 (Windows 2000 LAN Manager)
| OS CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_2000::-
| Computer name: srv2
| NetBIOS computer name: SRV2
| Workgroup: WORKGROUP
...
```

This particular script identified a potential match for the host operating system.

To check for known SMB protocol vulnerabilities, we can invoke one of the _smb-vuln_ NSE scripts. We'll take a look at **smb-vuln-ms08-067**, which uses the **--script-args** option to pass arguments to the NSE script.
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -v -p 139,445 --script=smb-vuln-ms08-067 --script-args=unsafe=1
10.11.1.5
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-04 11:27 EST

...
```

In this case Nmap identifies that the specific SMB service is missing at least one critical patch for the MS08-067 vulnerability.


# NFS Enumeration
Network File System (NFS) is a distributed  file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984. It allows a user on a client computer ato access files over a computer network as if they were on locally-mounted storage.

NFS is often used with UNIX operating systems and is predominantly insecure in its implementation. It ca be somewhat difficult to set up securely, so it's not uncommon to find NFS shares open to the world. This is quite convenient for us as penetration testers, as we migth be able to leverage them to collect sensitive information, escalate our privileges, and so forth.

### Scanning for NFS Shares
Both _PortMapper_ and _RPCbind_ run on TCP port 111. RBPbind maps RBP services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve.

The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with aparticular RPC program number.
The rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number (often TCP port 2049) so it can communicate with the requrested service. We can scan these ports with **nmap** using the following syntax:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254
```

We can use NSE scripts like **rpcinfo** to find services that may have registered with rpcbind:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254
...
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.72

| 100227 2,3 2049/tcp nfs_acl
|_ 100227 2,3 2049/udp nfs_acl
...
```

### Nmap NFS NSE Scripts
Once we find NFS running, we can collect additional information, enumerate NFS services, and discover additional services using NSE scripts found in the **/usr/share/nmap/scripts/** directory:
```
kali@kali:~$ ls -1 /usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs*
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs-ls.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs-showmount.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs-statfs.nse
```

We can run all three of these scripts using the wildcard character (\*) in the script name:
```
kali@kali:~$ nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.72
...
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.72
PORT STATE SERVICE
111/tcp open rpcbind
| nfs-showmount:
|_ /home 10.11.0.0/255.255.0.0
```

In this case, the entire **/home** directory is being shared and we can access it by mounting it on our Kali virtual machine. We will use **mount** to do this, along with **-o nolock** to disable file locking, which is often needed for older NFS servers:
```
kali@kali:~$ mkdir home
kali@kali:~$ sudo mount -o nolock 10.11.1.72:/home ~/home/
kali@kali:~$ cd home/ && ls
jenny joe45 john marcus ryuu
```

Based on this file listing, we can see that there are a few home directories for local users on the remote machine. Digging a bit deeper, we find a filename that catches our attention, so we try to view it:
```
kali@kali:~/home$ cd marcus
kali@kali:~/home/marcus$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 2 1014 1014 4096 Jun 10 09:16 .
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 Sep 17 2015 ..
-rwx------ 1 1014 1014 48 Jun 10 09:16 creds.txt
kali@kali:~/home/marcus$ cat creds.txt
cat: creds.txt: Permission denied
```

It appears we do not have permission to view this file. Taking a closer look at the file permissions, we can see that its owner has a UUID of 1014, and also read(r) and write(w) and execute(x) permissions on it. What can we do with this information? Since we have complete access to our kali machine, we can try to add a local user to it using the **adduser** command, change its UUID to 1014, **su** to that user, and then try accessing the file again:
```
kali@kali:~/home/stefan$ sudo adduser pwn
Adding user `pwn' ...
Adding new group `pwn' (1001) ...
Adding new user `pwn' (1001) with group `pwn' ...
Creating home directory `/home/pwn' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for pwn
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
Full Name []:
Room Number []:
Work Phone []:
Home Phone []:
Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]
```

Based on the output abvoe, we can see that the new user has a UUID of 1001, which is not really what we need. We can change it to 1014 using **sed** and confirm the change  took place. The **-i** option is used to replace the file in-place and the **-e** option executes a script. In this case, that happens to be **'s/1001/1014/g'**, which will globally replace the UUID in the **/etc/passwd** file:
```
kali@kali:~/home/marcus$ sudo sed -i -e 's/1001/1014/g' /etc/passwd
kali@kali:~/home/marcus$ cat /etc/passwd | grep pwn
pwn:x:1014:1014:,,,:/home/pwn:/bin/bash
```

So far so good, Let's try to **su** to the newly added _pwn_ user, verify that our UUID has indeed changed, and then try accessing that file again. We will use the **su** command to change the current login session's owner. Then we'll use id to display our current user ID. Finally, we'll try access the file again:
```
kali@kali:~/home/marcus$ su pwn
pwn@kali:/root/home/marcus$ id
uid=1014(pwn) gid=1014 groups=1014
pwn@kali:/root/home/marcus$ cat creds.txt
Not what you are looking for, try harder!!! :O)
```


# SMTP Enumeration
We can also gather information about a host or network from vulnerable mail servers. The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) supports several interesting commands, such as VRFY and EXPN. A VRFY request asks the server to verify an email address, while EXPN asks the server for the membership of a mailing list. These can often be abused to verify existing users on a mail server, which is useful information during a penetration test. Consider this example:
```
kali@kali:~$ nc -nv 10.11.1.217 25
(UNKNOWN) [10.11.1.217] 25 (smtp) open
220 hotline.localdomain ESMTP Postfix
VRFY root
252 2.0.0 root
VRFY idontexist
550 5.1.1 <idontexist>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient
table
^C
```

Notice how the success and error messages differ. The SMTP server happily verifies that the user exists. This procedure can be used to help guess valid usernames in an automated fashion. Consider the following Python script that opens a TCP socket, connects to the SMTP server, and issues a VRFY command for a given username:
```
#!/usr/bin/python
import socket
import sys
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
print "Usage: vrfy.py <username>"
sys.exit(0)
# Create a Socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# Connect to the Server
connect = s.connect(('10.11.1.217',25))
# Receive the banner
banner = s.recv(1024)
print banner
# VRFY a user
s.send('VRFY ' + sys.argv[1] + '\r\n')
result = s.recv(1024)
print result
# Close the socket
s.close()
```


# SNMP Enumeration
SNMP is based on UDP, a simple, stateless protocol, and is therefore susceptible to IP spoofing and replay attacks. In addition, the commonly used SNMP protocols 1, 2, and 2c offer no traffic encryption, meaning that SNMP information and credentials can be easily intercepted overa a local network. 

### The SNMP MIB Tree
The SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) is a database containing information usually related to network management. THe database is organized like a tree, where branches represent different organizations or network functions. The leaves of the tree (final endpoints) correspond to specific variable values that can then be accessed, and probed, by an exxternal user. The IBM Knowledge Center contains a wealth of information about the MIB tree.

For example, the followign MIB values correspond to specific Microsoft Windows SNMP parameters and contains much more than network-based information:
![[Pasted image 20220413144935.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220413145500.png]]

### Scanning for SNMP
To scan for open SNMP ports, we can run **nmap** as shown in the example that follows. The **-sU** option is used to perform UDP scanning and the **--opn** option isused to limit the output to only display open ports:
```
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sU --open -p 161 10.11.1.1-254 -oG open-snmp.txt
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-05-01 06:26 MDT
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.7
Host is up (0.080s latency).
PORT STATE SERVICE
161/udp open|filtered snmp
MAC Address: 00:50:56:89:1A:CD (VMware)
Nmap scan report for 10.11.1.10
Host is up (0.080s latency).
PORT STATE SERVICE
161/udp open|filtered snmp
MAC Address: 00:50:56:93:4E:DC (VMware)
...
```

Alternatively, we can use a tool such as _onesixtyone_, which will attempt a brute force attack against a list of IP addresses. First we must build text files containing community strings and the IP addresses we wich to scan:
```
kali@kali:~$ echo public > community
kali@kali:~$ echo private >> community
kali@kali:~$ echo manager >> community
kali@kali:~$ for ip in $(seq 1 254); do echo 10.11.1.$ip; done > ips
kali@kali:~$ onesixtyone -c community -i ips

```

# Windows SNMP Enumeration Example
We can probe and query SNMP values using a tool such as **snmpwalk** provided we at least know the SNMP read-only community string, which in most cases is "public".

### Enumerating the Entire MIB Tree
Using some of the MIB values provided in Table 6, we can attempt to enumerate their corresponding values. Try out the following examples against a known machine in the labs, which has a Windows SNMP port exposed with the community string "public". This command enumerates the entire MIB Tree using the **-c** option to specify the community string, and **-v** to specify the SNMP version number as well as the **-t 10** to increase the timout period to 10 seconds:
```
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 -t 10 10.11.1.14
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: "Hardware: x86 Family 6 Model 12 Stepping 2 AT/AT
COMPATIBLE - Software: Windows 2000 Version 5.1 (Build 2600 Uniprocessor Free)"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: iso.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.1.3.1.1
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 = Timeticks: (2005539644) 232 days, 2:56:36.44
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 = ""
...
```

### Enumerating Windows Users
This example enumerates windows users:
```
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.11.1.14 1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25
iso.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25.1.1.3.98.111.98 = STRING: "bob"

...
```

### Enumerating Running Windows Processes
Thes example enumerates the running windows proceses:
```
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.11.1.73 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.1 = STRING: "System Idle Process"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.4 = STRING: "System"

iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.372 = STRING: "csrss.exe"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.420 = STRING: "winlogon.exe"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.448 = STRING: "services.exe"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.480 = STRING: "lsass.exe"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2.488 = STRING: "lsm.exe"
...
```


### Enumerating Open TCP Ports
This example enumerates the open TCP ports:
```
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.11.1.14 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3
iso.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3.0.0.0.0.21.0.0.0.0.18646 = INTEGER: 21
iso.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3.0.0.0.0.80.0.0.0.0.45310 = INTEGER: 80
iso.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3.0.0.0.0.135.0.0.0.0.24806 = INTEGER: 135
iso.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3.0.0.0.0.443.0.0.0.0.45070 = INTEGER: 443
...
```

### Enumerating Installed Software
This example enumerates installed software:
```
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2.1 = STRING: "LiveUpdate 3.3 (Symantec Corporation)"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2.2 = STRING: "WampServer 2.5"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2.3 = STRING: "VMware Tools"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2.4 = STRING: "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x86

iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2.5 = STRING: "Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable (x86)
- 11.0.61030"
...
```
