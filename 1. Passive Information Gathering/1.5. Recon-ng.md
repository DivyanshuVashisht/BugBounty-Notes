## Recon-ng

recon-ng is a module-based framework for web-based information gathering. Recon-ng displays the results of a module to the terminal but it also stores them in a database. Much of the power of recon-ng lies in feeding the results of one module into another, allowing us to quickly expand the scope of our information gathering.

According to the output we need to install various modules to use recon-ng

We can add modules from the recon-ng "Marketplace". We'll search the marketplace from the main prompt with **marketplace search**, providing a search string as an argument.

For example, we can search for modules that contain the term **github**
````
recon-ng][default] > marketplace search github
[*] Searching module index for 'github'...

````

Some of the modules, marked with an asteriks in the "K" column require credentials or API keys for third-party providers. The recon-ng wiki maintains a short list of keys used by its modules. Some of these keys are available to free accounts, while others require a subscription.

To learn more about a module use **marketplace info** followed by the module name. Since the GitHub modules require API keys, let's use this command to examine the **recon/domains-hosts-google_site_web** module:
````
[recon-ng][default] > marketplace info recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| path | recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web |
| name | Google Hostname Enumerator |
| author | Tim Tomes (@lanmaster53) |
| version | 1.0 |
| last_updated | 2019-06-24 |
| description | Harvests hosts from Google.com by using the 'site' operator. |
| required_keys | [] |
| dependencies | [] |
| files | [] |
| status | not installed |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[recon-ng][default] >
````

According to its description, this module searches Google with the "site" operator and it doesn't require an API key. Let's install the module with **marketplace install**:
````
[recon-ng][default] > marketplace install recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web
[*] Module installed: recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web
[*] Reloading modules...
[recon-ng][default] >
````

After installing the module, we can load it with **module load** followed by its name. Then, we'll use **info** to display details about the module and required parameters:
````
[recon-ng][default] > modules load recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web
[recon-ng][default][google_site_web] > info
Name: Google Hostname Enumerator
Author: Tim Tomes (@lanmaster53)
Version: 1.0
Description:
Harvests hosts from Google.com by using the 'site' search operator. Updates the
'hosts' table with the results.
Options:
Name Current Value Required Description
------ ------------- -------- -----------
SOURCE default yes source of input (see 'show info' for details)
Source Options:
default SELECT DISTINCT domain FROM domains WHERE domain IS NOT NULL
<string> string representing a single input
<path> path to a file containing a list of inputs
query <sql> database query returning one column of inputs
[recon-ng][default][google_site_web] >
````

The output contains additional information about the module now that we've installed and loaded it. According to the output, the module requires the use of a source, which is the target we want to gather information about.

We'll use **options SOURCE megacorpone.com** to set our target domain:
````
[recon-ng][default][google_site_web] > options set SOURCE megacorpone.com
SOURCE => megacorpone.com
````

Finally, we **run** the module:
````
[recon-ng][default][google_site_web] > run
---------------
MEGACORPONE.COM
---------------
[*] Searching Google for: site:megacorpone.com
[*] [host] www.megacorpone.com (<blank>)
[*] [host] vpn.megacorpone.com (<blank>)
[*] [host] www2.megacorpone.com (<blank>)
[*] [host] siem.megacorpone.com (<blank>)
[*] Searching Google for: site:megacorpone.com -site:www.megacorpone.com -
site:vpn.megacorpone.com -site:www2.megacorpone.com -site:siem.megacorpone.com

SUMMARY
-------
[*] 4 total (4 new) hosts found.
````

The results mirror what we found from the Netcraft DNS search. However, we haven't wasted our time here. Recon-ng results in a local database and these results will feed into other recon-ng modules.

We can use the **show hosts** command to view stored data:
````
[recon-ng][default][google_site_web] > back
[recon-ng][default] > show
Shows various framework items
Usage: show
<companies|contacts|credentials|domains|hosts|leaks|locations|netblocks|ports|profiles

[recon-ng][default] > show hosts

We have four hosts in our database but no additional information on them. 

Let's examine **recon/hosts-hosts/resolve** with **marketplace info**:
````
[recon-ng][default] > marketplace info recon/hosts-hosts/resolve
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| path | recon/hosts-hosts/resolve |
| name | Hostname Resolver |

The module description suits our needs so we will install it with **marketplace install**:

````
[recon-ng][default] > marketplace install recon/hosts-hosts/resolve
[*] Module installed: recon/hosts-hosts/resolve
[*] Reloading modules...
````

Once the module is installed, we can use it with **modules load**, and run **info** to display information about the module and its options:
````
[recon-ng][default] > modules load recon/hosts-hosts/resolve
[recon-ng][default][resolve] > info
Name: Hostname Resolver
Author: Tim Tomes (@lanmaster53)
Version: 1.0
Description:
Resolves the IP address for a host. Updates the 'hosts' table with the results.
Options:
Name Current Value Required Description
------ ------------- -------- -----------
SOURCE default yes source of input (see 'show info' for details)
Source Options:
default SELECT DISTINCT host FROM hosts WHERE host IS NOT NULL AND ip_address
IS NULL
<string> string representing a single input
<path> path to a file containing a list of inputs
query <sql> database query returning one column of inputs
Comments:
* Note: Nameserver must be in IP form.
````

As is clear from the above output, this module will resolve the IP address for a host.

We need to provide the IP address we want to resolve as our source. However, we want to leverage the database this time. If we use the "default" value, recon-ng will look up the host information in its database for any records that have a host name but no IP address.

Let's try out by leaving our source set to "default" and then **run** the module:
````
[recon-ng][default][resolve] > run
[*] www.megacorpone.com => 38.100.193.76
[*] vpn.megacorpone.com => 38.100.193.77
[*] www2.megacorpone.com => 38.100.193.79
[*] siem.megacorpone.com => 38.100.193.89
````

Now we have IP addresses of four domains.

If we **show hosts** again, we can verify th edatabase has been updated with the results of both modules:
````
[recon-ng][default][resolve] > show hosts
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| rowid | host | ip_address | region | country | module |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 | www.megacorpone.com | 38.100.193.76 | | | google_site_web |
| 2 | vpn.megacorpone.com | 38.100.193.77 | | | google_site_web |
| 3 | www2.megacorpone.com | 38.100.193.79 | | | google_site_web |
| 4 | siem.megacorpone.com | 38.100.193.89 | | | google_site_web |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
