## Security Headers Scanner

_Security Headers_, will analyze HTTP response headers and provide basic analysis of the target site's security posture. We can use this to get an idea of an organisation's coding and security practices based on the results.

Let's scan www.megacorpone.com and check the results.

You'll notice that the site would be missing several defensive headers, such as _Content-Security-Policy_ and _X-Frame-Options_. Thiese missing headers are not necessariyl vulnerabilities in and of themselves, but they could indicate web developers or server admins that are not familiar with server hardening.
