## User Information Gathering

We need to exercise some caution when we start gathering information on users. 

Let's begin our information gathering with some basic email harvesting. In this case, we will use _theHarvester_, which gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs from multiple public data sources.

For example, we can run theHarvester with **-d** to specify the target domain and **-b** to set the data source to search:

````
kali@kali:~$ theharvester -d megacorpone.com -b google
