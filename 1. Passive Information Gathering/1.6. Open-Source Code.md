## Open-Source Code

Source of interesting information are open-source projects and online code repositories, such as GitHub, GitLab and SourceForge.

Code stored online can provide a glimpse into the programming languages and frameworks used by an organisation. In some rare occasions, developers have even accidentally commited sensitive data and credentials to public repos.

The search tools for some of these platforms will support the Google search operators. 

For example, GitHub's search is very flexible. On GitHub, we will be able to search a user's or organizations' repos, but we need an account if we want to search across all public repos.

We can use **site:megacorpone.com filename:users** on GitHub search bar to look for any files with the word "users" in the name.

Our search only found one file - **xampp.users**. The file appears to contain a username and password hash that could be very useful when begin our active attack phase.

This manual approach will work best on small repos. For larger repos, we can use several tools to help automate some of the searchin, such as _Gitrob_ and _Gitleaks_. Recon-ng also has several modules for searching GitHub. Most of these tools require an access toekn to use the source code hosting provider's API.
