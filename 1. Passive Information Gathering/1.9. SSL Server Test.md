## SSL Server Test

Another scanning tool we can use is the SSL Server Test from Qualys SSL Labs. This tool analyzes a server's SSL/TLS configuration and compares it against current best practices. It will also identiry SSL/TLS related vulnerabilities, such as Poodle or Heartbleed. Let's scan www.megacorpone.com and check the results.

The results are not as bad as the Security Headers check. However, the weak Diffie-Hellman key exchange, RC4 ciphers has been recommended for several years due to multiple vulnerabilities. We can use these findings to get an insight on the security practices, or lack thereof, within the target organization.
