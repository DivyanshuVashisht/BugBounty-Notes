## Netcraft
Netcraft is an internet services company based in England offering a free web portal that performs various information gathering functions. The use of services such as those offered by Netcraft is considered a passive technique since we never interact with our target directly. 

We can use Netcraft's DNS search page (https://searchdns.netcraft.com) to gather information about the megacorpone.com domain. 

For each server found we can view a "site report" that provides additional information and history about the server by clicking on the file icon next to each site URL.

If we scroll down, we discover various "site technology" entries.

This list of subdomains and technologies will prove useful as we move on to active information gathering and exploitation.
