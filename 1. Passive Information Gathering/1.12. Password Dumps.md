## Password Dumps

Malicious hackers often dump breached crecentials on Pastebin or other less reputable websites. These password dumps can be extremely valuable for generating wordlists. For example, Kali Linu includes the "rock you" wordlist generated from a data breach in 2009.

Checking the email addresses we've found during user enumeration against password dumps can turn up passwords we could use in credential stuffing attacks.
