## OSINT Framework
The _OSINT Framework_ includes information gathering tools and websites in one central location. Some tools listed in the framework cover more disciplines than information security.

## Maltego
_Maltego_ is a powerful tool for data mining that offers an endless combination of search tools and strategies. 

Maltego searches thousands of online data sources, and uses extremely clever "transforms" to convert one piece of information to another. For example, if we are performing a user information gathering campaign, we could submit an email address, and through various automated searches, "transform" that into an associated phone number or street address. During an organizational information gathering exercise, we could submit a domain name and "transform" that into a web server, then a list of email address, then a list of associated social media accounts, and then into a potential password list for that email account.

The combinations are endless, and the discovered information is presented in a scalable graph that allows easy zoom-and-pan navigation.
