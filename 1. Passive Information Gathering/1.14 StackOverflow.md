# StackOverflow
The site's value from an information gathering perspective is in looking at the types of questions a given user is asking or answering. If we can reasonably determine a user on Stack Overflow is also an employee of our target organization, we may be able to infer some things about the organisation based on the employee's questions and answers.

For example, if we found a user that is always asking and answering questions about Python, it would be reasonable to assume they use that programming language on a daily basis, and it would likely be used at the organisation where they are employed.

Even worse, if we find employees discussing sensitive information such as vulnerability remediation on these types of forums, we could discover unpatched vulnerabilities during this phase.
