## Shodan

Shodan is a search engine that crawls devices connected to the Internet includeing but not limited to the World Wide Web. This includes the servers that run websites but also devices like routers and IoT devices.

Start by using Shodan to search for **hostname:megacorpone.com**

Shodan lists the IPs, services and banner information. All of this is gathered passibely without interacting with the client's web site.

This information gives us a snapshot of our target's Internet footprint. For example there are eight severs running SSH and we can drill down on this to refine our results by clicking on SSH uder Top Services.

Based on Shadan's results we know exactly which version of OpenSSH is running on each server. If we click on an IP address, we can retrieve a summary of the host. 

We can view the ports, services, and technologies used by the server on this page. Shodan will also reveal if there are any published vulnerabilities for any of the identified services or thechnologies. This information is invaluable when determining to start when we move to active testing.
