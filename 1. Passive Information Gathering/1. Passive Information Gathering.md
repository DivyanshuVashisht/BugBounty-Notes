## Passive Information Gathering

Passive Info gathering (also known as Open-source Intelligence or OSINT) is the process of collecting openly available information about a target, generally without any direct interaction with that target.

There are two different schools of thought on what constitutes of "passive" in this context.

In the strictest interpretation, we never communicate with the target directly. For example, we could rely on third parties for information, but we wouldn't access any of the target's systems or servers.

Using this approach maintains a high level of secrecy about our actions and intensions, but can also be cumbersome and may limit our results.

In a looser interpretation, we might interact with the target, but only as a normal internet user would. For example, if the target's website allows us to register for an account, we could do that. However, we would not test the website for vulnerabilities during this phase.
