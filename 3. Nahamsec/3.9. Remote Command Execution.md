# RCE
Remote Command Execution (RCE) is a broad term that's applied to vulnerabilities that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host oeprating system via the vulnerable application. This can also be done by injecting code into application which could be leveraged to execute arbitrary OS commands.


## Working
Imagine an application allows its users to cehck for whether or not an item in stock. This information is accessible by visiting the following URL:
`https://site.com/checkitem?id=5141`

However, the appliction fetches the above information  by running the following command in the background:
`$> ./checkStock 5141`
` 3 items available`

## Exploitation
A vulnerable application will allow an attacker to leverage this functionality by adding additinal OS commands to achieve RCE.
`https://site.com/checkitem?id=5141;ls`

The application will take the users input and execute at the OS level in the background and may look similar to the following:
`$> ./CheckStock 5141; ls`

In this example, the original command to check for item 5141 is still executed as expected, but once that command is finished, the application will also execute the ls command and provide its output to the attacker:

`$> ./CheckStock 5141; ls`
`3 items available`
`Index.php images css.htaccess`

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| pwd             | The full path of the current working directory (Print Working Directory) |
| uname           | Prints basic information about the operating system (uname -a)           |
| id              | Prints the current user, its group, and numeric IDs                      |
| hostname        | Prints the machine's hostname and domain name                            |


In addition to executing OS commands, an attacker may be able to inject code into the application, and leverage their code to execute arbitrary command on the application operating system. THis can be done in different ways such as file upload, modifying site content, debug functionalities and more.
