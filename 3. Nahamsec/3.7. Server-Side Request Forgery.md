# SSRF
In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. An SSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to make requests originating from the server.

- Blind SSRF - allows to scan for accessible hosts and ports
- Full Response - Allows you to see the entire response from the server
- Limited or No Response - Shows a portion of the response like the title of the page or No Response or you have access to resources but cant' see the directly

## Potential Blockers
- Whitelisting - Only allows a few domain names to be used in the request
- Blacklisting - Block access to internal IP addresses, domains or keywords
- Restricted Content - Type, extensions, or characters - Only allows a particular file type
- No Response - You may not be able to see the response from the request


## Potential Solutions
- Whitelisting - Finding an open redirect
- Blacklisting - Creating a custom CNAME and pointing it to our internal IP address on our target
- Restricte Content - Type, extension or characters - Manual fuzzing and creating a bypass
- No Response - JavaScript XHR request to retrieve file contents


## Things to keep in mind while fuzzing for SSRF:
- You are making a server side request
- You are browsing content that is rendering on the host machine
- There are different ways to llok for content on localhost other than "localhost" or 127.0.0.1
- You may need to use an open redirect to redirect the machine to your destination host
- The current host may be able to communicate with other machines on the network (that may require being on corporate VPN)
- Make sure the request comes fro the remote server and not your personal IP address

Tl;dr: You have a "browser" that's rendering web pages for you on the host machine.
