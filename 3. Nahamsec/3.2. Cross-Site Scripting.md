# Cross-Site Scripting
## What is XSS?
XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary client-side code on a victim's browser. XSS ca nbe used for phishing, exfiltrating data, account takeovers and more.

## How does XSS work?
- An attacker inserts a malicious script (or a payload) into the victim's browser
- When the victim encounters the script it executes in the victim's browser.
- A malicious payload is able to perform any action that the victim is able to perform.
- If the victim has special privileges it can be a serious vulnerability.


## Impact
- Read / Modify / Delete content of any page
- Steal a user's cookies or session and gain access to their account 
- Serve malicious content like phishing

## Different Types of XSS
1. Reflected XSS - Payload is injected from the victim's request. Victim must click a malicious link or navigate to an attcker-controlled property.
2. Stored XSS - Payload is stored server-side and can be triggered by a victim with no interaction outside of the application.
3. DOM XSS - The vulnerability is in the client-side code versus the server-side. Injection is still typically from the victim's request.


### Reflected XSS

| Request                        | Response            | Explanation    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------- |
| site.com/page?name=John        | Hello, John         | Normal request |
| site.com/page?name=<u>John</u> | Hello, <\u>John><\/u> | No XSS         |
| site.com/page?name=<u>John</u> | Hello, <u>John</u>  | Possible XSS   |

In this example, the payload is injected into the victim's request using the "name" parameter. In order for this to work, the victim must click this malicious link or navigate to an attacker-controlled property. https://example.com/page?param=<payload>.

### Stored XSS
Also known as persistent XSS.
- It stores the payload in the database.
- The payload is reflected back to the user when visiting a particular page.
- Once of the most famous stored XSS is in Tweetdeck.


The payload is stored **server-side** and can be triggered by a victim without any interaction outside of using the application.


### DOM XSS
DOM XSS happens when javascript reflects data from an attacker controlled resource ( for example within the URL) and passes it to a function later on.

Consider the following piece of code that could be exploited by linking the victim to the following URL:
https://example.com/#send-transaction<div/class="header__wrap"><a/href=javascritp:alert(0)><h1>pwn3d</h1></a><img/src=//unskid.me/dist/jesus.gif></div>
