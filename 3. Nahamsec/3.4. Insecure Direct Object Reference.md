# IDOR
Insecure Direct Object References occur when an application provies direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. This will allow a malicious attacker to access data belonging to other users by manipulating the request.

## How to look for IDOR
- Uderstand how the application works:
	1. How does it fetch data
	2. How does it create new data
	3. How does it delete or modify data

- Look for any numericla IDs in the requests
- Create two users in order to have accurate data (userID, objectID, etc).
- Sometimes application use "encryption" to obfuscate information such as the userID(such as base64).
- Automate using burp

## Take Note
Sometimes application use UUID's instead of numeric id's. UUID's are unpredictable long strings. They look like this:

They dont' protect against IDOR's but they do make it harder to exploit. Sometimes applications leak the UUID, on prupose or by accident. For example, when you visit another user's profile, they may have a profile photo that's stored on the website in a flder the same as their UUID:
