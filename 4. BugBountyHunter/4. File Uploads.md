# File Uploads
Almost every website offers the ability for a user to upload a file, usually an image for their profile photo or when sharing content. There is a 99% chance the eveloper has created a filter as to what files to allow and what to block, for example they won't want you uploading `.html` files for your **profile photo!**

When tseting file uploads you may find your file is uploaded to a third party domain, such as `.amazonaws.com` or even `.cloudfront.net`. This means the file has been stored on an external cloud service and thus the malicious file would not affect your target domain. **However** sometimes companies will add DNS records to subdomains pointing to their cloud service (usually S3 bucket). For example, `media.example.com` may be used to render images from their S3 bucket.

## How do they determine what the file is?
Imagine when editing your profile they may say **only photos are allowed**, but how are they actually validating it's a photo? It could be via `.extension` or even `mime type`. As well as this, are all photos saved in the same format regardless of the photo type we uploaded? For example if you uploaded a **.png** file, do they simply not care and will save as .jpg regardless? Let's explore some common things we can test in order to test their file uploads.

For the text below, imageing the feature you are testing only allows for .png and .jpg:
1. `Testing file extension` - Simple, I first test for .txt to check how strict the filter actually is. A .txt file is harmless and may not be filtered and may help me determine how they handle file uploads and tthey may be filtering based on **mailicious** extensions, rather than **valid extensions**. If the .txt file is successful, then I know the **file extension** is trusted server side. So lte's try cause some impact.
   
   If then trying to upload **.html, .php, .xml** in order to increase impact you notice the extension if filtered due to being malicious, then we can try **URL encoding** characters such as **Null bytes, %00, New lines, %0d%0a** and **tabs, %09%07** in order to bypass filters. For example:
   
   ![[Pasted image 20220419174109.png]]
   
   With the above request, using Burp suite you could then **Right Click** on `%0d%0a` in teh request, Click **Convert Selection** and choose **URL Decode**. You'll see your payload "disappear", and now when sending the request your payload will be sent to url encoded and may bypass filters. **The same can be achieved when using PASTE FROM FILE** if you have saved your specific payload via command line.

   If changing it to .txt or other extensions does not work, sometimes actually a lot of developers will sometimes create filters for **image/\***, meaning an **.svg** upload will work as it's content type is **image/svg+xml**. .svg files are classed as photos and some developers do not realise they can be used to acieve XSS. Not only this, but sometimes popular Frameworks can be the issue, as for example in Laravel you could have:
   
   ![[Pasted image 20220420153002.png]]
   
   The code says to only allow for **image**, however as described above an **.svg** file is considered an image! This would result in XSS. [This is defined here in Laravel in validation rules for images](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/validation#rule-image).
   
 
- `Testing content type and file headers` - If the file extension approach doesn't work, then next we can try playing with the content-type. Leaving the **file extension** as **.jpg** along with the correct image headers (ÿøÿà for example), we could simply try changing the **Content-Type** to **text/html**. When saved server side, the code may allow the file upload as **.jpg** is found for the extension, but when viewed the content type will be set to **text/html**. This is especially common if the URL to browse your file doen't have an extension by default and typically looks like, `https://www.example.com/media/QmVQcbUNxs3qV991rwAcpJp6mTFFvRV9JcJnEvZNy5Vzvh`. This is because the server is happy to save your upload due to it being **.jpg** with the correct headers, **ÿøÿà**, but then uses the **Content-Type** when viewed.

	**HOWEVER!** Changing the **Content-Type** isn't the only thing we can try here. Sometimes just changing this isn't enough, and it is recommend to add the corresponding file headers required for the file upload. For example for **text/html** you'd add `<html>code here`, and for **application/xml** you'd add `<?xml>`.
	
	
- `Testing filenames` - Using certain characters in the actual filename can help bypass filters. For example what happens if you provide a file name of `zseano.php/.jpg` - the code my see **.jpg** and allow, but the server actually writes it to the server as **zseano.php** and misses everything after the forward slash. Other common characters to try are `#, @, ', \, +, &,`\`. Don't forget to try something as simple as case sensitive filters, `.PhP`, although uncommon in 2022 in my opinion.

If the filename is saved based on your input, then you could check if the filename is on the page anywhere and you can smuggle XSS characters in the filename. Some developers may think users can't save files with < and > in them, but we are simply modifying the request via our proxy tool(burp suite).

Sometimes providing NO file extension (or even filename) will cause it to default to the content-type or file extension.

Sometimes if you leave the image header this is enough to bypass the checks. Below is a real payload used on a bug bounty program.
